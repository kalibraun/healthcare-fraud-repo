#  Fraud Detection in Healthcare Claims

This project aims to detect **fraudulent healthcare providers** by identifying suspicious patterns in claim volumes and durations using **inpatient** and **outpatient** data. Leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, the model highlights providers that submit an unusually high number of claims over short periods â€” a common indicator of potential fraud.

---

##  Objective

Detect fraudulent providers by analyzing patterns in claim behavior such as:

- Total number of claims submitted
- Average claim duration
- Inpatient vs. outpatient claim ratios
- Total amount reimbursed

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **XGBoost**
- **scikit-learn** for modeling and evaluation
- **Plotly**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** for visualization

---

##  Data Sources

- `training_fraud.csv` â€“ Contains labels for providers flagged as fraudulent (`PotentialFraud`)
- `inpatient_data.csv` â€“ Inpatient claim records
- `outpatient_data.csv` â€“ Outpatient claim records

> All data is assumed to be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/medicare-healthcare-claims-fraud-detection) or imported locally.

##  Key Features Engineered

- `TotalClaimCount`
- `TotalReimbursed`
- `InpatientClaimCount`
- `OutpatientClaimCount`
- `AvgClaimDuration` (if applicable)

##  Model Performance

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - ROC AUC Score
  - Precision / Recall / F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- **Visualizations**:
  - Interactive scatter plots of fraud probability vs. claim count
  - Boxplots and bar charts comparing fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent providers
  - ROC Curve

## ðŸ”¦ Insights

- Fraudulent providers tend to submit **higher-than-average claim volumes**
- Claim behavior patterns can be strong indicators of fraud
- Visualizations help highlight **high-risk providers** for further investigation
